##Project Description
-------
Thirty volunteers performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope,  3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity were captured at a constant rate of 50Hz. 
          

##Variable Explanations
--------
The dataset consists of 180 rows and 68 columns. Each row represents one actvity per subject, with measurements for each of the 66 selected features. Only measurements reflecting mean and standard deviation were selected for this dataset. All measurements have been normalized and bounded within [-1,1].

 
The 68 variables and their explanations are listed below.
